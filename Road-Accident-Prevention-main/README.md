# Road Accident Prevention using Deep Learning

## Aim 
Countless people use the highway at all hours of the day and night. Taxi drivers, bus drivers, truck drivers, and long-distance travelers all suffer from sleep deprivation. As a result, driving when sleepy becomes extremely dangerous.

The majority of accidents occur as a result of the driver's tiredness. So, to avoid these accidents, we'll be developing a model using Python, OpenCV, and Keras to create a system that will inform the driver when he gets tired. The implementation of this project idea in actual world could save the life of a random driver and will be extremely useful.

## Week 1 

During the week-1 I have revised the python basics and also did some problems, then I quickly started
learning python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn and get familiar with them I have uploaded some of 
the files which I worked in the Numpy folder. I have used the following links
1. [Numpy](https://youtu.be/93uKo-F9SSo)
2. [Pandas](https://youtu.be/V620hYtbD6s)
3. [Matplotlib](https://youtu.be/rLVNEzPf8fU)
4. [Seaborn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GUZXDef2U0)

## Week 2 and Week 3

During these two weeks I have learnt many Machine Learning Algorithms Like Linear regression, Logistic regression, KNN classfier, Support Vector Machine and many other algorithms and used these algorithms on some of the real world problems 
like fraud transaction detections, Loan Approval problem, Cancer type Classification problems etc. I have uploaded  the files which I worked in the ML Algorithms folder. I have used the following resources 
1. [Linear_Regression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUXdtN1W1FE)
2. [Logistic_Regression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCJdg7YBbAQ)
3. [Clustering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xvwt7y2jf5E)
4. [KNN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HKqjENq9OU)
5. [SVM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtKF996oEl8)
6. [Decision_Trees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmajweUFKvM)

## Week 4

During the week-4, I have learnt OpenCV and mediapipe python libraries and did a very small project named hand tracking.
It just takes a video as input in which we use our fingers to represent the numbers using the libraries I have found 
the number represented by the fingers and also have done many other small projects. I have uploaded  
the files which I worked in the OpenCV folder. I have used the following resources 

1. [OpenCV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQeoO7MI0Bs&t=4s)

## Week 5 and 6 

During these two weeks I have learnt Deep Learning and got acquainted with Neural Networks and Deep learning
and also studied about Keras, tensorflow and practicing building models using them. Also using keras and tensorflow
and the MNIST hand written digits dataset developed a model to identify the handwritten digit. I have uploaded  
the files which I worked in the Tensorflow folder. I have used the following resources 

1. [Deep_Learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZbbT5o_s2xq7LwI2y8_QtvuXZedL6tQU)
2. [Keras_Tensorflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFJeN9V1ZsI)

## Week 7 and 8

During this week started working on the Project develped the model and tried to debugg the errors ocurred. Files that are related to the project are 

1. [haarcascadefiles](https://github.com/Jaswanth03-cyber/SoC-2k22/tree/main/haarcascadefiles)
2. [models](https://github.com/Jaswanth03-cyber/SoC-2k22/tree/main/models)
3. [alarm.wav](https://github.com/Jaswanth03-cyber/SoC-2k22/blob/main/alarm.wav)
4. [main.py](https://github.com/Jaswanth03-cyber/SoC-2k22/blob/main/main.py)
5. [model.py](https://github.com/Jaswanth03-cyber/SoC-2k22/blob/main/model.py)


## Project working instructions 

Just run the the main.py python script after clonning the project and installing all the dependencies, camera will capture the frames and now by using these frames if u are sleepy or drowsy alarm will start making sounds. I have used jupyter notebook to implement the model

### Requirements
1. OpenCV
2. Mediapipe
3. Tensorflow
4. Keras
